# Bitcoin
Overview: 
* Functions to pull data for cryptocurrencies (from Binance) and run basic technical anaylsis across it
* Also has capacity to build a basic technical indicator trading model
* Returns list of what to buy based on the model's forecasted returns

Still a work in progress; half-hearted attempts at documentation made.
